    <h1>How to Write Stories</h1>
</div>

<p>
    This tutorial will help guide you on how to write code to make 
    interactive fiction.
</p>

<p>
    The stories are written using 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>,
    a simple text formatting language. With the story creator, this
    formatting also conveys extra meaning which is used in generating
    the interactive fiction website. 
</p>

<p>
    Here's what a snippet of story code looks like:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

You wake up to the sound of an alarm. You look to your clock and 
see that it's 8:00 AM.

*8:00AM!!* Your shift started at 7:00! You must have forgotten to
set the time correctly again.

[snooze: Forget it. You set the alarm to snooze.](next)
[get up: Get up and rush to work.](next)

## Morning: Work

Your boss looks at you.

### Chose "snooze" on last

"You're' three hours late!"

### Chose "get up" on last

"You're an hour and a half late!'"

###

You look to your watch. So it was.

<div class="page-header">
    <h1>Story Structure</h1>
</div>

<p>
    The stories are structured into chapters and then pages, where
    a day in the story (as in Monday, Tuesday, etc.) makes up the
    chapters, and the individual pages are each identified by a 
    time &amp; location. Many pages can share the same time &amp;
    location.
</p>
<p>
    Each page is composed of text and an optional set of choices. 
    Choices act as links, bringing readers to another page. Different
    choices can bring the reader to different pages. What choice
    the reader selected is also tracked.
</p>
<p>
    Tracking the reader's choice brings us to a feature for this
    story creator, which is that paragraphs of text on a given page
    can be made to appear only if the reader selected for a given 
    choice. More on this later.
</p>

<h2>Chapters</h2>

<p>
    A story is split up into multiple days, each acting as a sort
    of chapter. A single <code>#</code> sign is used to signal that 
    what follows is a day, and follows the format <code># Monday</code>. 
    For instance:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

...

# Tuesday

...

</code></pre>

<h2>Pages</h2>

<h2>Title (Time &amp; Location)</h2>

<p>
    Within each chapter are one or more pages. These are each identified
    by a time &amp; location. Multiple pages can share the same time
    &amp; location. A double <code>##</code> signals that what follows
    is the time &amp; location, and follows the format 
    <code>## Time: Location</code>. For instance:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

...

## Afternoon: School

...

## Afternoon: School

...

# Tuesday

...

</code></pre>

<h2>Text</h2>

<p>
    Within each page can be paragraphs of text. Multiple paragraphs are
    separated by an empty line. For instance:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

This sentence is part of the first
paragraph of text.

This sentence is part of the second
paragraph of text.

This sentence is part of the third
paragraph of text.

</code></pre>

<p>
    The text in the paragraphs can also be formatted. See the section on
    <a href="#how-to-format-text">How to Format Text</a> for more details.
</p>

<h2>Links (Choices)</h2>

<p>
    In addition to text, each page can provide one or more choices
    to determine what happens next in the story. These show up as 
    links to be clicked on that appear beneath the paragraphs of text.
</p>

<p>
    Links consist of three parts, two of which are optional. The first is
    what the text for the link will be. That's the only part that's mandatory.
    The second is which page the reader will be brought to when the link is
    clicked. The third is an identifier, which is optional, which is used to 
    keep track of what choices were picked down the line.
</p>
<p>
    The format is:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
[link text]()
[link text](page)
[identifier: link text](page)

</code></pre>

<p>
    So that actual links can look like the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
[eat breakfast: Eat breakfast before school](Monday > Morning: Kitchen)
[skip breakfast: Skip breakfast and go to school](Monday > Morning: School)

</code></pre>

<p>
    Which would produce links that look like the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <div class="list-group">
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Eat breakfast before school</a>
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Skip breakfast and go to school</a>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    See the section on <a href="#how-to-make-links">How to Make Links</a> 
    for more details.
</p>

<h2>Optional Paragraphs</h2>

<div id="how-to-make-links" class="page-header">
    <h1>How To Make Links</h1>
</div>

<h3>Basic Links</h3>

<p>
    At their most basic, these choices consist of two parts: the text
    that appears on the page, and what page the reader is to be taken
    to once the link is pressed. Links follow the format 
    <code>[Text to appear in the link](Page to bring the reader to)</code> where
    the text for the link is between the <code>[]</code> and the page between
    the <code>()</code>. For instance, the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
[Go to the next page](next)

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <div class="list-group">
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Go to the next page</a>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    That said, specifying a page is optional. When no target page is
    indicated, the link becomes unclickable. And so this code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
[You cannot click on this]()

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <div class="list-group">
        <a href="#" class="list-group-item disabled">You cannot click on this</a>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>Go Back/Forward Pages</h3>

<p>
    The target page can be specified by putting down <code>next</code> or 
    <code>last</code>, to indicate the next or last page in the story code.
    Remember that each page is identified by a time &amp; location. For 
    example:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
[Go to the previous page](last)
[Go to the next page](next)

</code></pre>

<p>
    Adding a <code>#</code> followed by a number indicates that the desired
    page is that many previous or following. For instance:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
[Go two pages back](last #2)
[Go three pages down](next #3)

</code></pre>

<h3>Using Day, Time, and/or Time &amp; Location</h3>

<p>
    Chapter names (days) can be used to identify which page to bring the 
    reader to when clicked. When clicked, the reader will be brought to 
    the first page in that day:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

You wake up feeling exhausted.

[Sleep all day](Tuesday)

# Tuesday

## Morning: Bedroom

...

</code></pre>

<div id="how-to-format-text" class="page-header">
    <h1>How to Format Text</h1>
</div>

<p>
    The text in the pages can be formatted using Markdown. The formatting
    only applies to the paragraphs of text, and not to the day, time &amp;
    location, or links.
</p>

<h2>Simple Formatting</h2>

<p>
    Text can be made <em>italicized</em> by enclosing them inside a pair of
    <code>*</code> symbols:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
This text *is going to be italicized*

</code></pre>

<p>
    Text can be made <strong>bold</strong> by enclosing them inside a pair of
    <code>**</code> symbols:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
This text **is going to be bold**

</code></pre>

<p>
    Text can be <s>struck through</s> by enclosing them inside a pair of
    <code>~~</code> symbols:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
This text ~~will have a line run through it~~

</code></pre>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<p>
    Quotes can also be inserted into the page content. Starting the line
    with a <code>&gt;</code> indicates that what follows is a quote. 
    For instance, the following code:
</p>


<pre><code class="markdown">
> This is a quote.

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <blockquote>
        This is a quote.
    </blockquote>
</div>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>
    To make unordered lists, having lines start with a single <code>-</code>
    or <code>*</code> will identify that it's part of a list.
    For instance, the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
* This is a list item
* This is another list item
* This is a third list item

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list item</li>
        <li>This is another list item</li>
        <li>This is a third list item</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    To make numbered lists, having lines start with a number and a 
    period like <code>1.</code> will identify that it's part of a list.
    For instance, the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
1. This is a list item
2. This is another list item
3. This is a third list item

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would yield the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <ol>
        <li>This is a list item</li>
        <li>This is another list item</li>
        <li>This is a third list item</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    Lists can also be nested by preceding the <code>*</code> or <code>-</code>
    with one or more spaces. For instance, the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
* Food
  * Pizza
  * Poutine
* Drinks
  * Ceasars
  * Water

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Food
            <ul>
                <li>Pizza</li>
                <li>Poutine</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Drinks
            <ul>
                <li>Ceasars</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
