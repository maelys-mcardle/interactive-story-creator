<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    This tutorial will help guide you on how to write code to make 
    interactive fiction.
</p>

<p>
    The stories are coded in 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>,
    a simple language to format text. With the story creator, this
    formatting also conveys extra meaning which is used in generating
    the interactive fiction website. 
</p>

<p>
    Here's what a snippet of story code looks like:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

You wake up to the sound of an alarm. You look to your clock and 
see that it's 8:00 AM.

*8:00AM!!* Your shift started at 7:00! You must have forgotten to
set the time correctly again.

[snooze: Forget it. You set the alarm to snooze.](next)
[get up: Get up and rush to work.](next)

## Morning: Work

Your boss looks at you.

### Chose "snooze" on last

"You're' three hours late!"

### Chose "get up" on last

"You're an hour and a half late!'"

###

You look to your watch. So it was.

[Decide something else](last)

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>
    The stories are structured at the highest level by the day (days 
    are like chapters), and then by the time/location (which make the
    individual pages.)
</p>
<p>
    Within these pages, there is some text, and there can be links.
    These links bring the reader to another page, and they can also
    represent choices. More on that later.
</p>
<p>
    Some text can be made optional, only to show when the reader has
    made a specific choice.
</p>

<h3>Days</h3>

<p>
    The stories are structured by the day. A single <code>#</code> sign
    is used to identify that what follows is a day. For instance:
</p>

<pre>
# Monday

...

# Tuesday

...

</pre>

<h3>Time &amp; Location</h3>
