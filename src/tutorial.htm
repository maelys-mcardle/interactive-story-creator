<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    This tutorial will help guide you on how to write code to make 
    interactive fiction.
</p>

<p>
    The stories are written using 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>,
    a simple text formatting language. With the story creator, this
    formatting also conveys extra meaning which is used in generating
    the interactive fiction website. 
</p>

<p>
    Here's what a snippet of story code looks like:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

You wake up to the sound of an alarm. You look to your clock and 
see that it's 8:00 AM.

*8:00AM!!* Your shift started at 7:00! You must have forgotten to
set the time correctly again.

[snooze: Forget it. You set the alarm to snooze.](next)
[get up: Get up and rush to work.](next)

## Morning: Work

Your boss looks at you.

### Chose "snooze" on last

"You're' three hours late!"

### Chose "get up" on last

"You're an hour and a half late!'"

###

You look to your watch. So it was.

[Decide something else](last)

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>
    The stories are structured into chapters and then pages, where
    a day in the story (as in Monday, Tuesday, etc.) makes up the
    chapters, and the individual pages are each identified by a 
    time &amp; location. Many pages can share the same time &amp;
    location.
</p>
<p>
    Each page is composed of text and an optional set of choices. 
    Choices act as links, bringing readers to another page. Different
    choices can bring the reader to different pages. What choice
    the reader selected is also tracked.
</p>
<p>
    Tracking the reader's choice brings us to a feature for this
    story creator, which is that paragraphs of text on a given page
    can be made to appear only if the reader selected for a given 
    choice. More on this later.
</p>

<h3>Day</h3>

<p>
    A story is split up into multiple days, each acting as a sort
    of chapter. A single <code>#</code> sign is used to signal that 
    what follows is a day, and follows the format <code># Monday</code>. 
    For instance:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

...

# Tuesday

...

</code></pre>

<h3>Time &amp; Location</h3>

<p>
    Within each chapter are one or more pages. These are each identified
    by a time &amp; location. Multiple pages can share the same time
    &amp; location. A double <code>##</code> signals that what follows
    is the time &amp; location, and follows the format 
    <code>## Time: Location</code>. For instance:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

...

## Afternoon: School

...

## Afternoon: School

...

# Tuesday

...

</code></pre>

<h3>Page Content</h3>

<p>
    Within each page can be paragraphs of text. Multiple paragraphs are
    separated by an empty line. For instance:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
# Monday

## Morning: Bedroom

This sentence is part of the first
paragraph of text.

This sentence is part of the second
paragraph of text.

This sentence is part of the third
paragraph of text.

</code></pre>

<h3>Text Formatting</h3>

<p>
    The text in the pages can be formatted using Markdown. The formatting
    only applies to the paragraphs of text, and not to the day, time &amp;
    location, or links.
</p>

<h4>Simple Formatting</h4>

<p>
    Text can be made <em>italicized</em> by enclosing them inside a pair of
    <code>*</code> symbols:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
This text *is going to be italicized*
</code></pre>

<p>
    Text can be made <strong>bold</strong> by enclosing them inside a pair of
    <code>**</code> symbols:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
This text **is going to be bold**
</code></pre>

<p>
    Text can be <s>struck through</s> by enclosing them inside a pair of
    <code>~~</code> symbols:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
This text ~~will have a line run through it~~
</code></pre>

<h4>Quotes</h4>

<p>
    Quotes can also be inserted into the page content. Starting the line
    with a <code>&gt;</code> indicates that what follows is a quote. 
    For instance, the following code:
</p>


<pre><code class="markdown">
> This is a quote.

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <blockquote>
        This is a quote.
    </blockquote>
</div>

<h4>Lists</h4>

<p>
    To make unordered lists, having lines start with a single <code>-</code>
    or <code>*</code> will identify that it's part of a list.
    For instance, the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
* This is a list item
* This is another list item
* This is a third list item

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <ul>
        <li>This is a list item</li>
        <li>This is another list item</li>
        <li>This is a third list item</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    To make numbered lists, having lines start with a number and a 
    period like <code>1.</code> will identify that it's part of a list.
    For instance, the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
1. This is a list item
2. This is another list item
3. This is a third list item

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would yield the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <ol>
        <li>This is a list item</li>
        <li>This is another list item</li>
        <li>This is a third list item</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>
    Lists can also be nested by preceding the <code>*</code> or <code>-</code>
    with one or more spaces. For instance, the following code:
</p>

<pre><code class="markdown">
* Food
  * Pizza
  * Poutine
* Drinks
  * Ceasars
  * Water

</code></pre>

<p>
    Would produce the following:
</p>

<div class="well">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Food
            <ul>
                <li>Pizza</li>
                <li>Poutine</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Drinks
            <ul>
                <li>Ceasars</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
