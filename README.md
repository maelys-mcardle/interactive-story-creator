# Interactive Story Creator

## Description

This project lets you create simple menu-driven interactive stories. 

These stories are written in [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/), a formatting language that balances formatting text files in a way that balances being comprehensible both to a human reader and computer program.

## Writing Interactive Fiction
