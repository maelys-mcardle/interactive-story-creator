# Interactive Story Creator

## Description

This project lets you create simple menu-driven interactive stories. 

These stories are written in [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/), a formatting language that balances formatting text files in a way that balances being comprehensible both to a human reader and computer program.

## Writing Interactive Fiction

See the contents of the `examples` directory for examples of how to write stories using this program.

## Running the Creator

At this time, copy the contents of the `src` directory in a folder on your computer, and open the `index.htm` file in a web browser like Firefox or Chrome. An internet connection is required at this time, as this loads libraries found online.
