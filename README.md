# Story Creator

## Description

This project lets you create 
[interactive novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_novel)
using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a lightweight 
text formatting language.

In other words, it lets you make your own "choose your own adventure" 
style online game, in the spirit of such titles such as
[Depression Quest](http://www.depressionquest.com/).

## Running the Story Creator

You can run the latest version of the creator 
[here](http://www.story-creator.ca/).

Alternatively, copy  the contents of the `src` directory in a folder 
on your computer, and open the `index.htm` file in a web browser like 
Firefox or Chrome.

An internet connection is required as this loads libraries found online. 
Also, the `Publish` and `Documentation` pages will not work when
viewing the files locally, as browsers like `Mozilla Firefox` and 
`Google Chrome` do not permit AJAX requests to local files.

## Writing Interactive Fiction

See the `Documentation` link on the creator for instructions on how to
write interactive fiction with this tool.
