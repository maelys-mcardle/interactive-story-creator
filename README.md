# Interactive Story Creator

## Description

This project lets you create 
[interactive novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_novel).
using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a lightweight 
text formatting language.

## Running the Story Creator

You can run the latest version of the creator 
[here](https://rawgit.com/maelys-mcardle/interactive-story-creator/master/src/index.htm).

Alternatively, copy  the contents of the `src` directory in a folder 
on your computer, and open the `index.htm` file in a web browser like 
Firefox or Chrome. 

An internet connection is required at this time, as this loads 
libraries found online. Also, the tutorial may not work when viewing
the files locally, as browsers like `Google Chrome` do not permit AJAX 
requests to local resources.

## Writing Interactive Novels

See the `Tutorial` link on the creator for instructions on how to
write interactive fiction with this tool.
