# Interactive Story Creator

## Description

This project lets you create simple menu-driven interactive stories. 

These stories are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown),
a formatting language that balances formatting text files in a way that 
balances being comprehensible both to a human reader and a computer.

## Running the Creator

You can run the latest version of the creator 
[here](https://rawgit.com/maelys-mcardle/interactive-story-creator/master/src/index.htm).

Alternatively, copy  the contents of the `src` directory in a folder 
on your computer, and open the `index.htm` file in a web browser like 
Firefox or Chrome. 

An internet connection is required at this time, as this loads 
libraries found online. Also, the tutorial may not work as browsers 
like `Google Chrome` prevent AJAX requests, which are used to load the 
tutorial.

## Writing Interactive Fiction

See the `Tutorial` link on the creator for instructions on how to
write interactive fiction with this tool.
